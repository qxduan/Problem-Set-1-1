<h2 id="me">Me</h2>
<p>The most crucial motive of taking this Web Programming/Engineering class was me hoping to develop my coding skills, 
  specially for industry purposes, and with functional skills to facilitate front-end/back-end
  programming learned, it will be a well valueable background to polish my resume shone. Prior to Tufts, 
  my coding skill was limited to Python language in Jupyter Notebook or Spyder environment. I have had
  experiences of scientific computing in Python, regards to Physics/Astrophysics. While 
  I am learning data structure in C++ this semester as well.

<h2 id="Food">Food & Resturant</h2>
<p>
<p>My top 3 favourite foods are: Korean/Japenese BBQ, Hot Pot/MaLaTang, home-made dumplings. </p>

    Flabbergasted when I first caught
    <a href="https://ygfmalatangwa.com/" target="_blank">YangGuoFu(YGF)</a>
    starting business in the states. It was a great substitution for hot pot, 
    for replacing the time-consuming setting up 
    of the big pot, and its overwhelming size, into a well customized bowl of soup base and ingredients as one wishes.

  <p>
  The best way to serve a bowl of YGF is with condiments of green onion slices, garlic slices, red chill oil,
  ground peanuts, and ice coffee! Don't forget some fruit/after dessert!
